Low-income and racial/ethnic minority communities were overrepresented in the essential workforce, often living in densely populated housing with limited access to adequate health care, protective equipment, or preventive measures.2 To address these disparities, it is critical to establish bidirectional communication with trusted community partners to ensure equitable implementation and buy-in. Preparedness planning and training must balance state/regional responsibilities with facility-level guidelines supported by statewide crisis standards of care to ensure inclusion of diverse healthcare settings (e.g., ICUs, nursing homes, morgues). Additionally, addressing disparities in legal resource capacity and including uninsured individuals in planning and recommendation is critical for effective preparation.
