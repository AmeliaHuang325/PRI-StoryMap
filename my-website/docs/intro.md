This document outlines the draft recommendations for the economic systems. Recommendations are structured into an overarching primary recommendation (bold font) followed by a line listing of supportive secondary and tertiary recommendations.

## Collaboratively Addressing Public Health Emergencies

The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated longstanding inequities that if left unaddressed will continue to leave people behind during future public health emergencies. Through an award from the New York City Economic Development Corporation, Columbia University is launching PRI with key partner the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy (CUNY SPH) and a consortium of academic, community, government, and corporate partners. In coordination with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and NYC Emergency Management, PRI will work hand-in-hand with New Yorkers in communities across the five boroughs to enhance their capacity to develop locally tailored health solutions, information, and resources to prepare for, respond to, and recover from future health crises.

## A Robust Multisector Partnership

PRI includes diverse partnerships with dozens of nonprofit, community, faith-based, research and corporate entities that responded to COVID-19 across NYC and are committed to PRIâ€™s whole-of-society approach.

Together, this diverse group of contributors brings the necessary resources, expertise, commitment, and vision to the critical task of equipping New York City to prepare and respond to future public health emergencies, and to invest in a more robust infrastructure, resulting in greater health equity among New Yorkers.
