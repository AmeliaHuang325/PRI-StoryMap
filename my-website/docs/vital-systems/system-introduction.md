# System Introduction

Vital health systems ensure the necessary resources and services to support societal members’ vital needs, such as medical and preventive care, nutritious food, clean water, and protection from the elements. This system includes the societal functions
- food, 
- medical and psychosocial care, 
- public health, 
- shelter, and 
- water. 

## Section I

### Section Introduction

This section focuses on building trust in public health interventions, ensuring non-criminalization in health responses, distributing resources equitably, navigating surge capacity to respond effectively to public health crises, expanding virtual care and telehealth infrastructure and reducing built environment inequalities. Recommendations prioritize multilingual outreach, equitable vaccine distribution strategies, privacy protections for sensitive health data, and the expansion of telehealth and virtual care to improve healthcare accessibility. There are recommendations to ensure community-driven feedback mechanisms, increase efforts towards culturally competent engagement, expanding  infrastructure for health equity to increase preparedness and response efforts. Additionally, recommendations focus on expanding virtual care and telehealth infrastructure, particularly for vulnerable populations, to ensure continuity of care during emergencies. Investments in multidisciplinary collaboration will improve surge capacity and operational flexibility to scale up healthcare services in response to crises.

### Structural Issues 

In NYC, historical disinvestment and structural racism have perpetuated disparities in access to health resources and services, particularly in TRIE neighborhoods.1 These inequities were starkly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, where certain populations and neighborhoods experienced disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Low-income and racial/ethnic minority communities were overrepresented in the essential workforce, often living in densely populated housing with limited access to adequate health care, protective equipment, or preventive measures.2 To address these disparities, it is critical to establish bidirectional communication with trusted community partners to ensure equitable implementation and buy-in. Preparedness planning and training must balance state/regional responsibilities with facility-level guidelines supported by statewide crisis standards of care to ensure inclusion of diverse healthcare settings (e.g., ICUs, nursing homes, morgues). Additionally, addressing disparities in legal resource capacity and including uninsured individuals in planning and recommendation is critical for effective preparation. It will be crucial to expand efforts and funding for local agencies and entities providing critical cross-cutting relief via health service referrals and other social services to New York City community members.

There are broad issues rooted in historical conditions of discrimination. Improving New York City’s ability to provide these needs securely and equitably will certainly improve health outcomes in future public health emergencies. New York City Society can take these steps, which are not comprehensive, but would be impactful for public health emergency outcomes:

- Reduce barriers to healthcare access within all communities experiencing any type of longstanding systemic discrimination and legal repercussions within the healthcare system,  based on race, religion, ethnicity, culture, national origin, legal status, economic status, educational attainment, cognitive/intellectual ability, gender identity, sexual preference, age, or any identifying variable by ensuring accessible and affordable healthcare options, while addressing and mitigating longstanding and unique experiences across groups of systemic racism, discrimination, or fears of deportation and legal repercussions within the healthcare system to understand the different drivers of distrust in various communities.
- Lack of access to healthcare services deeply impacts trust and, thus, the ability of public health authorities to communicate clearly.
- Historically marginalized  and immigrant communities faced significant barriers to accessing healthcare and information related to COVID-19 due to information barriers and resource disparities.

### Systemic Recommendations

The following specific actions would help New York City improve its response to future public health emergencies. They are organized by Preparedness Recommendations (which must be implemented in between public health emergencies) and Response Recommendations (changes in practice to how NYC deals with public health emergencies when they occur). While response recommendations require preparedness work,their outcomes and improvement are largely measured during emergency conditions.

Ensure that all public health interventions—including food security, healthcare access, and vaccination efforts—are designed with equity, transparency, prioritizing historically marginalized communities. Reduce barriers to healthcare access during public health emergencies by building more equitable healthcare infrastructure, since research shows susceptibility to misinformation is driven by lack of quality healthcare access.

‘Structural competence’ rather than ‘cultural competence’ is a means to address how medical structures produce health inequalities. This is a shift away from pedagogical approaches to inequalities, to produce structural change.
