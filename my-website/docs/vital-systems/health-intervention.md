# Public Health Interventions

## Recommendation S5 – PRIORITIZE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION BASED ON EQUITY

**Ensure that future public health interventions (e.g., for vaccination distribution and testing) integrate social equity considerations in prioritizing high-risk populations.**

S5.1 – Work in tandem across all partners to ensure that vaccine distribution strategies and regulations reflect a nuanced approach to social equity – emphasizing the needs of at-risk populations, including those with underlying health conditions, New Yorkers with disabilities, essential workers, low-income minority households, and other disadvantaged and low-resource communities.

S5.3 – Ensure data protections for the collection and dissemination of personal information, including racial / ethnicity data and legal working status during public health campaigns.

S5.3.1 – Ensure that vaccination efforts by third-party entities (including pharmacies and other health clinics) adequately protect consumer health data and/or do not inquire about immigration status. Systems that are not adequately set up to collect and protect private racial and ethnic data should not attempt to collect such data. 

S5.4 – Address challenges around language access and technological barriers that can reduce community access to essential vaccination campaigns, resulting in inequitable health outcomes. Ensure that non-English speakers and low-resource individuals have equal access to vaccination services and clear calls to action by maintaining an up-to-date referral list and sending resources where individuals engage (i.e., schools). 

S5.4.1 – Understand the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in advance and address misinformation about vaccines wherever possible, particularly with marginalized communities. 

S5.4.2 – Form partnerships with social media platforms to promote science-based vaccine information and to label misinformation and disinformation. 

S5.4.3 – Strengthen communication and relationships with community medical providers (e.g., provider coalitions, user-friendly information websites, etc.) 

S5.5 – Expand vaccination campaigns beyond primarily or exclusively existing pharmacy networks.  When mobile vaccine units are deployed, ensure they are bookable well in advance and organized to return to the same site for second vaccinations if it is a two-shot regimen. 

### Indicators:

## Recommendation V9 – STREAMLINED VACCINE GUIDANCE

**Streamline policy guidance with regard to vaccine requirements and eligibility across NYC jurisdictions and industries.**

V9.1 – Streamline and coordinate policy guidance across NYC metropolitan area jurisdictions so that inter-borough workers can easily adapt to rules across jurisdictions. 

V1.3 – Assess the acceptability and impact of vaccine incentives across different target groups to inform future decision-making about the role of incentives and requirements in improving vaccine uptake.

S1.1.3 – Build trust through additional partnerships and evidence-based strategies with well-established community organizations and associations, including Community Health Workers, Community Engagement Specialists, and CBOs, while ensuring healthcare policies and interventions are efficient, effective, and transparently communicated.

### Indicators:

(V9.1) NYC DOHMH will coordinate with state and federal health agencies to develop standardized vaccine eligibility and rollout guidelines, ensuring clarity for healthcare providers and the public within 12 months – Y/N

(V1.3) NYC DOHMH, in partnership with Community Based Organizations, will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of vaccine incentive programs across diverse target groups to determine their impact on vaccine uptake and acceptability, publishing a report with findings and recommendations by 2026 – Y/N

(V9; V9.1) NYC DOHMH, working with the New York State Immunization Advisory Council (NYS IAC) and the Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR) will establish a centralized public information platform to provide real-time updates on vaccine guidance, booster recommendations, and eligibility changes within 12 months – Y/N

(S1.1.3) NYC Office of Health Equity, in partnership with Community Health Workers, will establish new community engagement partnerships to improve health communication and vaccine uptake within 18 months – Y/N

## Recommendation V7 – SCALE UP CAPACITY

**Provide flexibility, best practices, and the legal capacity for healthcare facilities to adapt or scale up capacity to meet evolving challenges to protect patients and staff.**

V7.1 – Implement pre-crisis healthcare surge plans, including ICU and staff expansion.

V7.1.1 – Develop specific surge capacity plans for departments beyond ICUs, such as mortuary services, environmental cleaning, engineering (e.g., oxygen supply systems), and other non-respiratory critical care units (e.g., neurology or infectious disease units for hemorrhagic fevers or encephalitis). 

V7.1.2 – Expand options for just-in-time training of clinical patient care skills and rapid deployment of pre-identified healthcare staff able to be trained or with skills to train others.

V7.2 – Formalize preparedness plans for the expedited training and rapid redeployment of healthcare staff from less critical areas to emergency departments and ICUs during crisis periods. 

V7.3 – Adopt emergency clinical and operational protocols at the facility level to streamline care in emergency contexts, optimizing capacity for severely ill patients and ensuring flexibility in meeting emergent challenges such as reduced PPE, reduced staff, or limited quantities of medicines. 

V7.3.1 – Consider mandatory staff training and detailed preparedness plans at the healthcare facility level to more effectively manage and respond to future surges in patient demand while adhering to patient care standards or crisis standards of case. 

V7.4 – Establish technical assistance resources to support non-healthcare  emergency response functions in organizations providing relief efforts 

V7.5 – Encourage adoption of reusable PPE strategies, including elastomeric respirators, to ensure long-term sustainability and preparedness for equipment shortages 

V7.7 – Integrate labor and workforce representatives into preparedness and planning processes to ensure all staff, including non-clinical roles, have a voice in institutional decision-making during crises. 

### Indicators:

(V7.2) NYC DOHMH will establish rapid-response training modules for healthcare staffing surges, with deployment protocols in place within 18 months – Y/N

(V7.1.2)NYC DOHMH will develop just-in-time training modules for surge staffing deployment, training additional staff within 12 - 18 months – Y/N

(V7.3) NYC DOHMH will require all public healthcare facilities to implement standardized emergency clinical/operational protocols (e.g., PPE rationing guidelines, medication prioritization frameworks) and achieving a strong rate of compliance within 12-18 months – Y/N
