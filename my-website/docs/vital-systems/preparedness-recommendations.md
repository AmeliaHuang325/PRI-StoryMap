# Preparedness Recommendations

## Recommendation V1 – IMPROVE TRUST IN PUBLIC HEALTH

**Strengthen open, bi-directional dialogue with communities to build trust and support the amplification of public health efforts.**

V1.1 – Expand multilingual community engagement to improve vaccine trust and counter misinformation.

V1.1.2 – Include other prevention efforts in the expansion of communications, including, masking, social distancing, and improving air ventilation and filtration. 

V1.2 – Adopt a standardized approach of recruitment, engagement, and education of community partners to establish systems of community outreach that can serve as informational and educational hubs for community residents. 

V1.2.1 – Maintain an open, bi-directional dialogue with trusted community entities and individuals regarding ongoing public health efforts such as vaccine safety and effectiveness, addressing vaccine hesitancy, susceptibility to disease, and perceived risks associated with the vaccine and the health risks of viruses themselves, in order to improve trust during epidemics/pandemics.

V1.4 – Strengthen the trustworthiness of public health and health care systems among communities, prioritizing dialogue around prevention and mitigation measures among those most likely to experience the worst outcomes based on historical harms and public health data.
