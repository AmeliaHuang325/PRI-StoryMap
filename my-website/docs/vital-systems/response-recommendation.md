# Response Recommendations

## Recommendation S3 – SURGE EFFORTS IN HIGH-RISK AREAS – 
**Expand and improve access to critical testing and vaccination efforts in high-risk communities.**

S3.1 – Expand bilateral partnerships (such as COVID-19’s Test & Trace) with trusted community entities to strengthen trust and structural competency in government health initiatives among communities facing current and historic injustices as well as New Yorkers with disabilities.

S3.2  For maximum efficiency, and to further reduce access barriers, bring services directly into shelters, housing programs for the elderly, harm reduction centers, etc.

S3.3 – To ensure that language and cultural barriers are mitigated, consider the expanded use of Community Engagement Specialists (CES) as well as collaborating in cultural events/activities to build rapport with community members and bridge cultural and language barriers.

S3.4 – Employ census data and other community-level indices to identify high-risk areas that may include communities with disproportionately low-income populations, underlying health conditions, essential workers, and minority neighborhoods.  

S1.2 - Surge Capacity within historically disinvested civil society organizations. 

S1.2.1 – Provide direct funding opportunities to smaller BIPOC grassroots organizations and informal networks to ensure that all communities, including those historically discriminated against, can access government funds and implement uniquely tailored solutions.

S1.2.2 – Before a public health emergency, establish a financial model that allows the direct and rapid transition of large funds into informal networks, potentially through a fiscal agent. 

S1.2.3 – NGOs and community associations should advise and assist government officials in applying a social equity lens for public health policies and interventions. 

V6 – Establish best practices for ensuring ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork within healthcare facility departments to ensure a coordinated response and comprehensive support to patients during a public health crisis. 

V6.1.1 – Ensure frequent and transparent communication across teams to ensure staff are informed regarding workflow changes, shifting protocols, or other relevant updates. 

V6.1 – Establish mechanisms to ensure close coordination across various teams affiliated with patient care, including key ICU staff, palliative care teams, radiology teams, social workers, chaplains, pharmacies, and other relevant support staff. This may entail integrated workflows in patient care plans, or clinical pathways with shared milestones.
