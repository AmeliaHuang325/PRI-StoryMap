# System Introduction

Ensures the physical, technical, and virtual infrastructure to support societal operations, such as energy sources, movement of people and goods, and communication and information-sharing technologies. This system includes the societal functions:

- energy supply, 
- logistics and transport, 
- public works, and 
- telecommunications.

The infrastructure in New York City is notably inequitable, with significant differences in the quality and access to digital infrastructure, energy access, public transit options, and urban spaces such as streets, sidewalks, and green spaces across neighborhoods. We cannot respond effectively and successfully to public health emergencies without addressing these inequities (Spatial Equity NYC: 2022 Report Card, 2022). Improving New York Cityâ€™s ability to provide these needs securely and equitably will certainly improve health outcomes in future public health emergencies. New York City Society can take these steps, which are not comprehensive, but would be impactful for public health emergency outcomes:

- Recategorize internet access as a public utility to close the digital divide and increase equity in accessing essential virtual services, such as online education and telehealth;
- Adequately fund and renovate public transit options throughout the metropolitan area to provide expanded routes, increased accessibility features, and adaptive systems for emergency response, focusing on underserved neighborhoods and areas prone to service disruptions during health emergencies more equitable mobility and adaptability to emergency conditions;
- To broaden transit options, improve bicycle safety, including identifying high-risk areas and improving biking infrastructure, to ensure that biking offers a safe mode of transportation, particularly in low-income, low-access communities;
- Recognizing the unintended environmental benefits associated with the stay-at-home period (which included a significant improvement in air quality via a reduction in nitrogen dioxide compared to prior years), consider additional measures that would reduce urban vehicular traffic and air pollution levels in densely crowded communities, including air quality monitoring;
